# NPnL
A non-linear solution to perspective n lines problem, i. e. pose estimation from 3D-2D lines' correspondences.

## Description
 
 An initial guess is given from a pose not far away since optimization method needs intialization. 
 
 Run the code and adjust the parameters of the synthetic lines and poses to see the results.
